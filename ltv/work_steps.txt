Step 1:
    create a temp table to save all the users after PV from 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31 --Done  2770587

Step 2:
    extract all the transactions of users from 2021-01-01 to 2021-06-29  -- Done  778260

Step 3:
    Calculate the rate of users without transaction  0.2809

Step 4:
    Use all the transactions of 2021-01-01 to 2022-03-31 as the training set to get result (Done)

Step 5:
    Adjust all the T is over 90 to 0

Step 6:
    Calculate Arpu -Arpu 127, comparing 134 from structural model. The result looks not bad

Step 7:
    Compare the predict revenue with the true revenue and get the percentage  - working on it
    some users have only one frequency, some have multiple trans, some have one trans in test period

Step 8:
    Apple the formula LTV = ARPU / Churn Rate to get the LTV
